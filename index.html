							label: "<p>Overview This document provides definitions for all the terms and metrics used in the Supply Chain Monitor and other TAG TrustNet documentation.\nSupply Chain Monitor    Metric Description      Ad Effectiveness   Qualified The objective of having a qualified impression or ad spend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency. In TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request.   Qualified Viewable Ad spend or impressions are both qualified (see Qualified above) AND viewable.    Ad Effectiveness - Data Accessibility and Consistency   Confirmed by CV tool Ad spend or impressions that have been recorded by both the CV tool and DSP.   Confirmed by ad server, CV tool, and DSP Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, CV tool, and DSP   Confirmed by ad server, CV tool, DSP, and Exchange (beta) Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, CV tool, DSP, and exchange   Consistent timestamps Ad spend or impressions that had timestamps recorded within 1 minute for the ad server, CV tool, and DSP.   Unduplicated impressions Ad spend or impressions where the impressions were reported as unique by the DSP.    Ad Effectiveness - Know your supplier   Confirmed publisher domain Ad spend or impressions where the ad server, CV tool, and DSP all recorded the same domain.   Exchange works with publisher directly Ad spend or impressions where the exchange works with the publisher directly based on its log file records and sellers.json data, along with the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file   Supply Chain is TAG verified Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Verified    Ad Delivery Compliance   Ads.txt implemented Ad spend or impressions where the publisher has an ads.txt and app-ads.txt file.   Sellers.json implemented Ad spend or impressions where the exchange or SSP has a sellers.json file.   Consistency of ads.txt, sellers.json, and log-level data The seller ID from the SSP log file matches the seller ID (also called the Publisher’s Account ID) in the ads.txt or app-ads.txt file AND the seller ID in the sellers.json file   Supply Chain is TAG CAF Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Verified   Supply Chain is TAG BSC Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Verified    Delivery Quality   Measurable Ad spend or impressions were able to be measured for viewability as determined by the CV tool.   Viewable according to CV Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the CV tool being used.   Non-Blocked Requests Ad spend or impressions where the requests were not blocked because they met the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign. (DoubleVerify only)   Allowed Ad spend or impressions met the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign and had no violations (blocks for inappropriate content, IVT, or App\/Site\/Language. (DoubleVerify only)   Monitored Ad spend or impressions where the DoubleVerify monitoring services were applied, were not blocked and had no violations from DoubleVerify. (DoubleVerify only)   Brand safe Ad spend or impressions determined to be brand safe as determined by the CV tool.   Non-IVT Ad Spend or impression is determined to be delivered to a human as determined by the CV tool.   Brand safe and non-IVT Ad spend or impressions determined to be both brand safe and non-IVT as determined by the CV tool.    Cost Efficiency   DSP and Exchange provided cost breakdown (beta) Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost   DSP and Exchange provided cost breakdown with matching clearing price (beta) Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost and clearing price records match   % Spend to Publisher The percent of the ad spend that went to the publisher for ad spend or impressions.    Other TAG TrustNet Terms    Metric Description     Ad Effectiveness A measurement of how successfully ads are being purchased that meet the goals of a campaign. The goals may include target audience, brand safety, fraud, and other criteria.   Ad Spend The total amount of money spent to purchase impressions programmatically, which includes both delivery cost and media spend.   Ad Spend Productivity A measurement of buying ads using the least amount of the ad spend to meet the goals of a campaign. This measure combines both ad effectiveness and cost efficiency   Cost Efficiency A measurement of how successfully ads are being purchased using the least amount of the ad spend.   Delivery Costs The amount of ad spend paid for impressions that includes everything except the payment to the publisher. Delivery cost typically includes platform fees paid to intermediaries (including ad servers, DSPs and SSPs) and data.   Live Compliance Performing compliance checks based on impression log-level data in near real-time of a supply chain to industry regulations, standards, and certifications.   Live Reconciliation Harmonizing, matching, and recording impression delivery log records across a supply chain in near real-time.   Media Spend The amount of ad spend paid for impressions that goes directly to the publisher.   Node Manager The TAG TrustNet product that customers log into to view the Supply Chain Monitor, configure their node, and manage users.   Supply Chain Monitor The TAG TrustNet dashboard for an agency or advertiser that uses a Sankey diagram to show data about the flow of inventory across programmatic participants, from the ad server to the publishers.    </p><p></p>",

							label: "<p>Benefits Why should I participate?    TAG TrustNet is a cross-industry network running an always-on platform making the industry more accountable, responsible and efficient. The platform was validated with major brands, agencies and tech vendors over a 2-year pilot and is positioned to contribute to the continued growth of the industry by enabling Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles: know your business partners, know their business practices, make timely informed decisions. While providing accountability and compliance, TAG TrustNet is driving business value and efficiencies for network participants at a minimal cost compared to the benefits it generates.   What are the participant benefits relative to costs?    Based on a cost in a 1 to 2% range of the advertising spend depending on volume, the cost\/benefit ratio can reach a high multiple depending on how the reconciled data is used. The network provides a range of direct benefits, that can be enhanced over system integrations and applications.   Is a DLT network adding a layer of complexity?    DLT is a breakthrough in various industries as a technology solution taking away the complexities and inefficiencies of supply chains. It allows companies to share and reconcile transaction data among trusted business partners in line with their contractual agreements in a secure and trusted collaborative environment. It most notably takes away the need for lots of different integrations between different organisations, simplifies legal agreements among participants, and allows to automate them over smart contracts. Compliance information becomes readily available and always-on reporting contributes to the reduction of expensive reconciliation and auditing.   If I already get log files from other supply chain participants, why would I need this?    Building log file integrations with every partner in the ecosystem is expensive. Maintaining them when they are up and running is also expensive because it comes with a substantial commitment to keep technology up to date: over time partners will change their technology, naming conventions, access settings or specifications. With TAG TrustNet only one integration is required to get access to the logs of every other network member. Moreover, log file data can be downloaded already pre-reconciled according to defined rules and used for automated business agreement management. For these reasons, for most companies DLT will be a cheaper, more efficient way to get access log files than other methods.   Does the industry need common log file standards if it has DLT?    Log files reconciliation requires log file data provided by various individual supply chain participants to be consistent. One way to address this question is to define detailed standards for log file formats, data fields naming conventions, taxonomies and meanings. To come to an agreement on industry logging standards is taking time and will require significant investments from adtech vendors to adjust their logging systems.\nThe other approach is to write log file data to the TAG TrustNet DLT network, where it is automatically harmonised to a common network format at the moment it is written. This approach requires less investments from ad-tech vendors, as it allows to use any formats, taxonomies and naming conventions as long as they can be harmonised to a common format. The only standard required to avoid any ambiguity is to define the meaning of data fields. With this approach the log files reconciliation functionality may be supported by the industry much faster with minimal changes required from ad-tech vendors.\n   What are the advantages of TAG TrustNet over just using a CV tool (such as IAS or DoubleVerify)?     In general, CV Tools provide ad effectiveness impression data, blocking and pre-bid tools. They do not cover cost efficiency (supply chain costs) or ad delivery\/reconciliation metrics. Here are the additional benefits TAG TrustNet provides:  Confirming what site and application ads actually appeared on. Matched log-level data from the DSP, SSP, ad server and CV company are used to confirm the domain that was recorded for an impression from each platform. If there are differences this can help identify technical problems, misplacement, and domain spoofing. Matching cost data from the DSP and SSP means you can analyse standard verification metrics leading to better business decisions. TAG TrustNet allows you to evaluate how industry standards (ads.txt and sellers.json) and certification (TAG) get implemented in a single place to improve brand safety, and reduce fraud, malware and piracy.       What does TAG TrustNet deliver for ads.txt that you cannot get from any other solution?    There is no other solution available today that allows to cross-verify impression log files of ads coming from multiple supply chain data sources. TAG TrustNet allows to compare the ads.txt file from a publisher, the sellers.json file from an exchange, and the impression log file from the SSP to ensure these files exist and consistently describe their relationship and the seller\/buyer identifiers with what appears in the log file.   Compliance What has TAG TrustNet done to comply with data protection laws?    TAG TrustNet does not allow its members to process Personal Data or otherwise link data within the TAG TrustNet with other data held by a participant to create Personal Data. Every TAG TrustNet member shall comply with TAG TrustNet Member Requirements, which state that log-level data provided for ingestion into TAG TrustNet shall not include any Personal Data and, as such, should fall outside of the scope of data protection laws, including, without limitation, the GDPR and the CCPA. All Personal Data, and any data fields which represent “pseudonymous data,” shall be removed before the underlying dataset is ingested into TAG TrustNet.  “Personal Data” means any information defined as “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or other similar term under applicable data protection laws.   While impression timestamps and oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs that are ingested into TAG TrustNet might be considered “pseudonymous data” in some circumstances, it is “anonymous data” in this case because:\n\u0026ndash; It is not possible for Fiducia, as a platform provider for TAG TrustNet, to use this data to identify an individual and;\n\u0026ndash; TAG TrustNet obfuscates these data fields when they are exported to reasonably prevent anyone from linking TAG TrustNet impression records to an individual (see below for more details). In addition to the above, Fiducia, as a platform provider, takes the following steps to reduce risks of re-identifiability of data ingested by, or exported from, TAG TrustNet, so as to achieve the standards of anonymization under applicable data protection laws (such as by not allowing re-identification via the “means reasonably likely to be used” by a third party, per the GDPR standard for determining whether data is “identifiable”):\n\u0026ndash; For all supported data sources, the TAG TrustNet Node Data Connectors filter any data fields that represent Personal Data from processing in the TAG TrustNet. Only data fields outlined in TAG TrustNet Member Requirements are ingested to by TAG TrustNet for processing.\n\u0026ndash; When data is exported by TAG TrustNet Members to external databases, the TAG TrustNet Node obfuscates oRTB Bid Request Impression ID, oRTB Bid Request ID, and Timestamp data fields as follows. oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs and oRTB Bid Request IDs are replaced with anonymous impression IDs, which cannot be linked back to original oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs or oRTB Bid Request IDs. Timestamps are rounded to 1-hour intervals.\n   General Information What is a distributed ledger?    It is a type of database which stores transaction records and is consensually shared, synchronized and accessible across multiple organisations, sites, institutions, or geographies. A distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralized database, which is more prone to failures, cyber-attacks and fraud, as it is administered by a single organisation and therefore has a single point of failure.\n   What is distributed ledger technology or DLT?    The terms blockchain and DLT are often used interchangeably. Blockchain is a particular type of DLT which was popularized by Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the ledger of transactions is as a sequence of blocks of data linked together through cryptography. The name comes from the fact that the ‘blocks’ are ‘chained’ in this fashion.   What is a DLT network?    A DLT Network is a network of computers, called network nodes, which implement a distributed ledger by running specialised software and communication protocols to share, synchronise and access the ledger records. When a ledger update happens, these nodes apply a consensus mechanism to agree on the ordering of transaction records and whether they should be included. The consensus mechanism allows the ledger to be tamper resistant and immutable and containing only confirmed and validated transactions. Because the nodes contain identical replicas of ledger records, users of nodes know that “What you see is what I see” when they access the ledger.   What is a permissioned DLT network?    TAG TrustNet is a permissioned network, as opposed to unpermissioned networks like Bitcoin that are open to anyone. It is pemissioned in three ways : (a) the participants need to agree to the governance and control principles to participate to the network, (b) the participants need to be approved to become network members, (c) the participants need to comply with the network minimum requirements at all times.\n   What is a smart contract?    A smart contract is a computer program stored in a distributed ledger network wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger. A smart contract might represent terms in a contract in law and create a legally enforceable obligation under the legislation of an applicable jurisdiction. Smart contracts allow organisations to automate their business relationships using software code with enforceability based on the distributed ledger records.   Governance Why should trade associations set up a DLT network?    To resolve the industry accountability problem – which in a technology driven industry essentially requires a technology solution – by implementing an always-on decentralised technology infrasturcture able to reconcile impression data in the context of an industry network, to enforce measurable industry standards, certifications and legal requirements on an ongoing basis. This cannot be achieved with centralised solutions controlled by individual entities, but requires an industry-wide approach and trade associations are best placed to play that role.   Who defines the requirements and makes the decisions?    A network governance entity formed by a balance of trade bodies and industry representatives.   Who operates the network?    As a trade body representing the industry, TAG is supervising the TAG TrustNet operations, conducted jointly with Fiducia as the platform provider.   How do the network requirements get enforced?    Requirements that are measurable over the impression log data provided to the platform get enforced over the DLT platform. Requirements that are not measurable will go through a traditional audit process.   How does the network fight fraud?    Any company joining the network needs to comply with minimum requirements to become a TAG TrustNet member allowed to use the network over a node. This includes the need to get identified as a legitimate legal entity and to be issued a tracking TAG-ID. The requirements define the data that needs to be included in the data feeds of providers. The reconciliation of this data among supply chain participants allows a company to detect discrepancies between the different data sets providing a signal for potential fraud. Under certain conditions, a company may be prevented from participating to transactions should the ledger provide evidence that it does not comply with network requirements at all times.   Who gets access to the data?    A consent framework is activated as part of the network functionality. Depending on the case, access to data may require one or more parties to provide their consents. As all consents can easily be provided by all parties over their nodes this process is easily managed using the network functionality. Consents are automatically enforced and data providers remain in control of access as they voluntarily can decide whether to report data or not.   Who can build applications?    Anyone in the industry can contribute to the development of the network application ecosystem using the platform API providing access to the distributed ledger.   Does the network create a new monopoly?    For TAG TrustNet to deliver all its benefits it has to be widely adopted across the industry as a collaborative effort to implement a “new standard” in the way to conduct business in a more accountable, responsible, sustainable and efficient way. This is the reason the network needs to be set-up by the industry for the industry as a consortium under an open governance that truly represents theindustry. Rather than creating a monopoly, the network is helping to create a fair and open marketplace based on accountability with the enforcement of self-defined rules that all participants across the supply chain agree to implement consistently at all times.   Membership for Supply Chain Participants What is the process to join TAG TrustNet as a Supply Chain Participant?    For Supply Chain Participants (such as ad servers, CVs, DSPs, and Exchanges\/SSPs) here is a summary of the process to join:\n Agree to the network requirements and sign the TAG TrustNet Membership Agreement Get verified as a legitimate legal entity and get a network ID Sign the TAG TrustNet Licensing \u0026amp; Service Level Agreement Complete the Node and Data Assessment Form Get a Data Connector built and approved Get a Network Node set-up allowing you to import and share data with other network members Set up ongoing data feed(s) based on advertiser requests     What does is the cost to join as a Supply Chain Participant?    For TAG members with a TAG ID the TAG TrustNet membership is free. To have an active node on the network to share data, the only cost is a one-time activation fee of $5k, $10k or $15k depending on annual digital advertising revenue. The activation fee is waived for all companies joining TAG TrustNet on or before December 31, 2021.   How do I send data to TAG TrustNet?    Data is to be sent to the network using standard delivery mechanisms. It gets usually delivery to a cloud bucket (Amazon s3, Google GCP) or accessed via SnowFlake or other access points. As part of the data integration process, members are required to provide an example or a live data feed which will be used to create a TAG TrustNet Network Adaptor that will automatically ingest, match and harmonise data within the network.   Why do I need to provide logs?    Log-level data must be provided by all TAG TrustNet Members in order for their impression data to be deterministically matched across supply chains.   How is my data used by the network?    Member data is ingested into the network and matched with impressions data from other network members sharing the same identifier that is activated at the request of advertisers. The matched data is recorded in the distributed ledger and (i) shared with the advertiser over the TAG TrustNet Supply Chain Monitor and (ii) included in the reconciled data that can get exported by advertisers into their own systems.   What control do I have over my data?    A consent framework is part of the network functionality. Access to data may require one or more parties to provide consent and all consents are automatically enforced within the network infrastructure. The data provider always remains in control of data access.   Technical Questions What is the Reconciliation SDK?    The Reconciliation SDK (software development kit) is a tool developed by Fiducia that can be installed on publisher sites and applications. It creates a log file record ID map when an ad is requested that can then be shared with every supply chain participant. With this ID map, log files of various supply chain participants can all be matched deterministically line to line. The SDK is preserving consumer privacy and cannot be used for consumer tracking.   Does TAG TrustNet have any additional tag requirements for advertisers or agencies?    TAG TrustNet uses existing log files that supply chain partners can already provide. The only time an additional tag is needed is when the TAG Reconciliation service is delployed. Whether or not this is needed gets determined as part of the initial supply chain mapping exercise.   </p>",
