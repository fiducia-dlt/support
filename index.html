							value: "Ads.txt",
							label: "<p>The following section describes what ads.txt is and how you should use this information.\nWhat is ads.txt and app-ads.txt This is a standard introduced in 2017 by the IAB. It requires publishers to list all of the companies who are authorized to sell their inventory in specific format, at a specific location—for both websites (ads.txt) and applications (app-ads.txt). The objective of this standard is to reduce fraud by allowing buyers to identify those companies who are authorized to sell a publisher’s inventory. If a company is not on this list and is trying to sell a publisher’s inventory, then it is likely fraudulent. It is a best practice to only buy from websites and apps that have an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file to reduce the chances that you are buying fraudulent inventory. For more information click here: https:\/\/iabtechlab.com\/ads-txt\/.\nHow is TAG TrustNet checking if websites and applications have these files? TAG TrustNet has built its own web crawler to check if the ads.txt or app-ads.txt files are present on websites and apps.\nWhat does it mean if the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file? As indicated above, the IAB spec requires that these files must contain this authorized seller data in a specific format at a specific location. If the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file it can mean one of the following:\n The file does not exist the domain or app that was provided in the DSP log file was invalid, and it is not possible to find the related ads.txt or app-ads.txt file (for example, comcast.tubitv or b00kdsgipk) The format of the file is wrong (according to the IAB specification). There is some other technical problem with it meeting the IAB specification.  I only want my DSP to buy from sites that have ads.txt or app-ads.txt files, but I see from the TAG TrustNet report that this is not happening. Why is this happening and what should I do? Almost every DSP and SSP has built their own web crawler to look for ads.txt and app-ads.txt files, and there will be differences in the rules that are used by different crawlers to determine if the files are valid or not. Some options on how to approach your DSP are:\n Send them the TAG TrustNet report that shows the sites and apps without ads.txt or app-ads.txt files and ask them to review this list. Just be aware that some of these websites and apps may actually have an ads.txt file according to your DSP—because the criteria used for determining a valid file is different from the ones used by TAG TrustNet. Manually check all of the domains (or just the ones that have significant spend) that do not have these files according to the TAG TrustNet report. This can be done by going to the Supply Report, downloading the CSV file, and then sorting it by \u0026ldquo;Ads.txt implemented\u0026rdquo; and then spend. For the ones that you can verify do not have these files, ask your DSP to explain why you are buying from them. Note: when you manually check files like this, you WILL see ads.txt files on website and apps that TAG TrustNet said do not have one, because you will not readily see the technical problems that made the file invalid. To manually look up an ads.txt file, just add \u0026ldquo;\/ads.txt\u0026rdquo; to the end of the top-level domain. For example, to look up the ads.txt file for yahoo.com, just enter yahoo.com\/ads.txt into your browser. It should return the ads.txt file if there is one.  </p><p>ads.txt</p><p>app-ads.txt</p><p></p>",

							value: "FAQ",
							label: "<p>Benefits Why should I participate?    TAG TrustNet is a cross-industry network running an always-on platform making the industry more accountable, responsible, and efficient. The platform was validated with major brands, agencies and tech vendors over a 2-year pilot and is positioned to contribute to the continued growth of the industry by enabling Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles: know your business partners, know their business practices, make timely informed decisions. While providing accountability and compliance, TAG TrustNet is driving business value and efficiencies for network participants at a minimal cost compared to the benefits it generates.   What are the participant benefits relative to costs?    Based on a cost in a 1 to 2% range of the advertising spend depending on volume, the cost\/benefit ratio can reach a high multiple depending on how the reconciled data is used. The network provides a range of direct benefits, that can be enhanced over system integrations and applications.   Is a DLT network adding a layer of complexity?    DLT is a breakthrough in various industries as a technology solution taking away the complexities and inefficiencies of supply chains. It allows companies to share and reconcile transaction data among trusted business partners in line with their contractual agreements in a secure and trusted collaborative environment. It most notably takes away the need for lots of different integrations between different organisations, simplifies legal agreements among participants, and allows to automate them over smart contracts. Compliance information becomes readily available and always-on reporting contributes to the reduction of expensive reconciliation and auditing.   If I already get log files from other supply chain participants, why would I need this?    Building log file integrations with every partner in the ecosystem is expensive. Maintaining them when they are up and running is also expensive because it comes with a substantial commitment to keep technology up to date: over time partners will change their technology, naming conventions, access settings or specifications. With TAG TrustNet only one integration is required to get access to the logs of every other network member. Moreover, log file data can be downloaded already pre-reconciled according to defined rules and used for automated business agreement management. For these reasons, for most companies DLT will be a cheaper, more efficient way to get access log files than other methods.   Does the industry need common log file standards if it has DLT?    Log files reconciliation requires log file data provided by various individual supply chain participants to be consistent. One way to address this question is to define detailed standards for log file formats, data fields naming conventions, taxonomies and meanings. To come to an agreement on industry logging standards is taking time and will require significant investments from adtech vendors to adjust their logging systems.\nThe other approach is to write log file data to the TAG TrustNet DLT network, where it is automatically harmonised to a common network format at the moment it is written. This approach requires less investments from ad-tech vendors, as it allows to use any formats, taxonomies and naming conventions as long as they can be harmonised to a common format. The only standard required to avoid any ambiguity is to define the meaning of data fields. With this approach the log files reconciliation functionality may be supported by the industry much faster with minimal changes required from ad-tech vendors.\n   How does TAG TrustNet compliment the use of Ad Verfication tool providers?    In general, Ad Verification Providers deliver ad effectiveness impression data, blocking and pre-bid tools. They do not cover cost efficiency (supply chain costs), ad delivery\/reconciliation, and compliance to industry standards. By incorporating your Ad Verification data within TAG TrustNet you are able to:\nConfirm what site and application ads actually appeared on. Matched log-level data from the DSP, Exchange\/SSP, ad server and Ad Verification company are used to confirm the domain that was recorded for an impression from each platform. If there are differences this can help identify technical problems, misplacement, and domain spoofing.\nMatching cost data from the DSP and Exchange\/SSP means you can analyse standard verification metrics leading to better business decisions.\nTAG TrustNet allows you to evaluate how industry standards (ads.txt and sellers.json) and certifications (TAG) get implemented in a single place to improve brand safety, and reduce fraud, malware and piracy.\nTAG TrustNet reconciles supply chain participants data producing a single shared truth that can be used for discrepancy management, managing partner and tag deployments and improving operational efficiency.\n   What does TAG TrustNet deliver for ads.txt that you cannot get from any other solution?    There is no other solution available today that allows to cross-verify impression log files of ads coming from multiple supply chain data sources. TAG TrustNet allows to compare the ads.txt file from a publisher, the sellers.json file from an exchange, and the impression log file from the exchange\/SSP to ensure these files exist and consistently describe their relationship and the seller\/buyer identifiers with what appears in the log file.   Compliance What has TAG TrustNet done to comply with data protection laws?    TAG TrustNet does not allow its members to process Personal Data or otherwise link data within the TAG TrustNet with other data held by a participant to create Personal Data. Every TAG TrustNet member shall comply with TAG TrustNet Member Requirements, which state that log-level data provided for ingestion into TAG TrustNet shall not include any Personal Data and, as such, should fall outside of the scope of data protection laws, including, without limitation, the GDPR and the CCPA. All Personal Data, and any data fields which represent “pseudonymous data,” shall be removed before the underlying dataset is ingested into TAG TrustNet.  “Personal Data” means any information defined as “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or other similar term under applicable data protection laws.   While impression timestamps and oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs that are ingested into TAG TrustNet might be considered “pseudonymous data” in some circumstances, it is “anonymous data” in this case because:\n\u0026ndash; It is not possible for Fiducia, as a platform provider for TAG TrustNet, to use this data to identify an individual and;\n\u0026ndash; TAG TrustNet obfuscates these data fields when they are exported to reasonably prevent anyone from linking TAG TrustNet impression records to an individual (see below for more details). In addition to the above, Fiducia, as a platform provider, takes the following steps to reduce risks of re-identifiability of data ingested by, or exported from, TAG TrustNet, so as to achieve the standards of anonymization under applicable data protection laws (such as by not allowing re-identification via the “means reasonably likely to be used” by a third party, per the GDPR standard for determining whether data is “identifiable”):\n\u0026ndash; For all supported data sources, the TAG TrustNet Node Data Connectors filter any data fields that represent Personal Data from processing in the TAG TrustNet. Only data fields outlined in TAG TrustNet Member Requirements are ingested to by TAG TrustNet for processing.\n\u0026ndash; When data is exported by TAG TrustNet Members to external databases, the TAG TrustNet Node obfuscates oRTB Bid Request Impression ID, oRTB Bid Request ID, and Timestamp data fields as follows. oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs and oRTB Bid Request IDs are replaced with anonymous impression IDs, which cannot be linked back to original oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs or oRTB Bid Request IDs. Timestamps are rounded to 1-hour intervals.\n   How does TAG TrustNet verify correct implementation of IAB Tech Lab standards?    TAG TrustNet can verify the following:\n ads are coming from a publisher that has an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file.  ads are coming from an exchange that has a sellers.json file. based on log level data from the exchange, the exchange is listed as an authorized seller in the publisher’s ads\/app-ads.txt file, and the publisher is identified as a known source of inventory in the exchange’s seller.json file. This is technically done by verifying the seller ID from the exchange\/SSP log file matches the seller ID (also called the Publisher’s Account ID) in the ads.txt or app-ads.txt file AND the seller ID in the sellers.json file.     General Information What is a distributed ledger?    It is a type of database which stores transaction records and is consensually shared, synchronized and accessible across multiple organisations, sites, institutions, or geographies. A distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralized database, which is more prone to failures, cyber-attacks and fraud, as it is administered by a single organisation and therefore has a single point of failure.\n   What is distributed ledger technology or DLT?    The terms blockchain and DLT are often used interchangeably. Blockchain is a particular type of DLT which was popularized by Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the ledger of transactions is as a sequence of blocks of data linked together through cryptography. The name comes from the fact that the ‘blocks’ are ‘chained’ in this fashion.   What is a DLT network?    A DLT Network is a network of computers, called network nodes, which implement a distributed ledger by running specialised software and communication protocols to share, synchronise and access the ledger records. When a ledger update happens, these nodes apply a consensus mechanism to agree on the ordering of transaction records and whether they should be included. The consensus mechanism allows the ledger to be tamper resistant and immutable and containing only confirmed and validated transactions. Because the nodes contain identical replicas of ledger records, users of nodes know that “What you see is what I see” when they access the ledger.   What is a permissioned DLT network?    TAG TrustNet is a permissioned network, as opposed to unpermissioned networks like Bitcoin that are open to anyone. It is pemissioned in three ways: (a) the participants need to agree to the governance and control principles to participate to the network, (b) the participants need to be approved to become network members, (c) the participants need to comply with the network minimum requirements at all times.\n   What is a smart contract?    A smart contract is a computer program stored in a distributed ledger network wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger. A smart contract might represent terms in a contract in law and create a legally enforceable obligation under the legislation of an applicable jurisdiction. Smart contracts allow organisations to automate their business relationships using software code with enforceability based on the distributed ledger records.   How can TTN members be confident that the impression data being reported to TAG TrustNet can be trusted?    There are three ways in which the data from TAG TrustNet can be trusted:\n The source of the data being reported to TAG TrustNet is authenticated by the network, so there is no question about who is providing the data. TAG TrustNet stores the impression data using distributed ledger technology which creates an immutable record of the transaction. The data for each impression that is collected from all the companies that were involved in delivering it can be compared to see if there are any inconsistencies.  It may be helpful to provide a little more information about the last point. One of the key deliverables from TAG TrustNet is that the impression data that is available from each vendor who was involved in delivering an impression is being stitched together to create a single record of each transaction across the supply chain. As a result of this, the data about the same impression from different sources can be compared and inconsistences can be identified. For example, if impression is reported by DSP, but not reported by exchange\/SSP or ad server - most likely it was not delivered. Here are some other examples of this:\n The impression clearing price from a exchange\/SSP reports can be compared to that reported by the DSP. The publisher domain recognised by a exchange\/SSP can be compared to the publisher domain recognised by a verification tool (if they do not match it may be a sign of domain spoofing). An exchange\/SSP\u0026rsquo;s-reported platform fee can be cross-checked with payment data from publishers.  It should be noted that TAG TrustNet cannot guarantee that vendors will report data correctly, but it registers every piece of impression level information received from vendors in the distributed ledger\u0026ndash;ensuring that after receipt impression data can’t be changed and remains immutable. If a vendor changes data in their systems after it was reported to TTN it may be detected and proven.\n   What is the environmental impact expected to be for TAG TrustNet?    Some blockchain detractors have been claiming that blockchains have a massive negative impact on the environment due to high energy consumption. This is probably due to a misunderstanding around the Bitcoin use of blockchain and other types of blockchains. What is true for the Bitcoin as a public network based on a “proof-of work” protocol, requiring a digital-labor intensive “mining” process with high energy demands to validate each new block of data, is radically different for permissioned private networks. In a permissioned network, such as the one implemented by TAG TrustNet, each block can get validated by a handful of nodes acting as notaries, with the energy consumption of not more than a few PCs. The expectation with permissioned networks is that in most cases the efficiency gains provided by DLT - reducing paper trails and running automated processes to reconcile, record, audit data - will have a significant positive impact on the environment rather than the other way around. In addition to this, the TAG TrustNet platform runs distributed ledger transactions only to register large blocks of impression data instead of doing that for every impression. This further reduces the energy consumed by the platform. For more details on the efficiencies of private blockchains, please see this article from R3, the company providing the private blockchain platform used by TAG TrustNet (https:\/\/www.r3.com\/blog\/just-how-energy-efficient-is-your-blockchain\/)\nIn addition to this:\n The technical infrastructure of TAG TrustNet uses AWS and Amazon has committed to being carbon neutral by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. TAG TrustNet is also working with the AD Net Zero Advertising Association through the IPA and other 3rd party companies to reduce the carbon footprint in programmatic advertising. This is done by providing transparency to advertisers and their agencies of the carbon footprint created by their ad campaigns and how they could reduce it. There are also other socially responsible benefits that are available to companies using TAG TrustNet. Currently this includes reducing ad spend going to criminal activity, and in the future may involve DEI, Corporate Social Responsibility and user privacy.     Governance Why should trade associations set up a DLT network?    To resolve the industry accountability problem – which in a technology driven industry essentially requires a technology solution – by implementing an always-on decentralised technology infrastructure able to reconcile impression data in the context of an industry network, to enforce measurable industry standards, certifications, and legal requirements on an ongoing basis. This cannot be achieved with centralised solutions controlled by individual entities but requires an industry-wide approach and trade associations are best placed to play that role.   How do the network requirements get enforced?    Requirements that are measurable over the impression log data provided to the platform get enforced over the DLT platform. Requirements that are not measurable will go through a traditional audit process.   How does the network fight fraud?    Any company joining the network needs to comply with minimum requirements to become a TAG TrustNet member allowed to use the network over a node. This includes the need to get identified as a legitimate legal entity and to be issued a tracking TAG-ID. The requirements define the data that needs to be included in the data feeds of providers. The reconciliation of this data among supply chain participants allows a company to detect discrepancies between the different data sets providing a signal for potential fraud. Under certain conditions, a company may be prevented from participating to transactions should the ledger provide evidence that it does not comply with network requirements at all times.   Who gets access to the data?    A consent framework is activated as part of the network functionality. Depending on the case, access to data may require one or more parties to provide their consents. As all consents can easily be provided by all parties over their nodes this process is easily managed using the network functionality. Consents are automatically enforced and data providers remain in control of access as they voluntarily can decide whether to report data or not.   Who can build applications?    Anyone in the industry can contribute to the development of the network application ecosystem using the platform API providing access to the distributed ledger.   Why is wide industry adoption important?    For TAG TrustNet to deliver its full benefits to its members it has to be widely adopted across the industry as a joint collaborative effort to implement a “new standard” in the way to conduct business in a more accountable, responsible, sustainable and efficient way. The network is helping to create a fair and open marketplace based on accountability with the enforcement of self-defined rules that all participants across the supply chain agree to implement consistently at all times.   Intermediaries and Publishers What is the process to join TAG TrustNet as an intermediary or publisher?    For intermediaries (such as ad servers, Ad Verification tools, DSPs, and Exchanges\/SSPs) and publishers here is a summary of the process to join:\n Become a TAG Member and be verified as a legitimate legal entity with a TAG ID Agree to the network requirements and sign the TAG TrustNet Membership Agreement Sign the TAG TrustNet Licensing \u0026amp; Service Level Agreement Complete the Node and Data Assessment Form Get a Data Connector built and approved Get a Network Node set-up allowing to import and share data with other network members Set up ongoing data feed(s) based on advertiser requests     What does is the cost to join as an intermediary or publisher?    For TAG members with a TAG ID the TAG TrustNet membership is free. To have an active node on the network to share data, the only cost is a one-time activation fee of $5k, $10k or $15k depending on annual digital advertising revenue. The activation fee is waived for all companies joining TAG TrustNet on or before December 31, 2021.   How do I send data to TAG TrustNet?    Data is to be sent to the network using standard delivery mechanisms. It usually gets usually delivery to a cloud bucket (Amazon s3, Google GCP) or accessed via SnowFlake or other access points. As part of the data integration process, members are required to provide an example or a live data feed which will be used to create a TAG TrustNet Network Adaptor that will automatically ingest, match and harmonise data within the network.   Why do I need to provide logs?    Log-level data must be provided by all TAG TrustNet Members for their impression data to be deterministically matched across supply chains.   How is my data used by the network?    Member data is ingested into the network and matched with impressions data from other network members sharing the same identifier that is activated at the request of advertisers. The matched data is recorded in the distributed ledger and (i) shared with the advertiser over the TAG TrustNet Supply Chain Monitor and (ii) included in the reconciled data that can get exported by advertisers into their own systems.   What control do I have over my data?    A consent framework is part of the network functionality. Access to data may require one or more parties to provide consent and all consents are automatically enforced within the network infrastructure. The data provider always remains in control of data access.   How will the data that I provide be safeguarded?     Information security is a top priority for our company and is governed and enforced by our leadership. Our security program is based on industry standards and best practices including NIST, ISO, CIS and others as required for specialized needs (cloud specific, application security, etc.) Through formalized Written Information Security Policy (WISP) and supporting standards and procedures, we are able to track and monitor the health of our program and better ensure all employees follow our standard for consistent security practices. Data is stored in encrypted AWS S3, encrypted EBS, encrypted records in Amazon Dynamo DB and in Amazon Aurora. Data is disposed securely according to AWS policies. We use AWS KMS for encryption of all EBS volumes and S3 buckets that contain customer data. Each customer is supplied with dedicated EC2 instances, EBS volumes and S3 buckets to work with his data using Fiducia software. Vendor risk is controlled by our formal Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) program to ensure any vendor who may host, store, transfer, process, manage, or otherwise handle your data and information is vetted prior to any engagement and meets a high standard of minimum security practices. Our contracts with third parties incorporate privacy and security obligations designed to ensure a level of data protection similar to and not less than our own privacy and security controls. We perform an annual business security risk assessment that addresses the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and information both internally and with the assistance of an outside third party assessor. We are in the process of preparing for a SOC2 Type 2 certification with an anticipated completion in 2024. Our certification scope will cover the totality of systems, facilities, and personnel that handle and process customer information.     Technical Questions What is the Reconciliation SDK?    The Reconciliation SDK (software development kit) is a tool developed by Fiducia that can be installed on publisher sites and applications. It creates a log file record ID map when an ad is requested that can then be shared with every supply chain participant. With this ID map, log files of various supply chain participants can all be matched deterministically line to line. The SDK is preserving consumer privacy and cannot be used for consumer tracking.   Does TAG TrustNet have any additional tag requirements for advertisers or agencies?    TAG TrustNet uses existing log files that supply chain partners can already provide. The only time an additional tag is needed is when the TAG Reconciliation Service is deployed. Whether or not this is needed gets determined as part of the initial supply chain mapping exercise.   How long does TAG TrustNet retain data?    Customer data is retained for up to 60 days at the impression level and up to 3 years for the aggregated data used within the TAG TrustNet web application.   </p><p></p>",

(DoubleVerify only)   Non-IVT Ad Spend or impression is determined to be delivered to a person ascdetermined by the Ad Verification tool. When calculating the % of impressions that are non-IVT, the impressions that are not matched between the DSP and Ad Verification systems are considered IVT.   OMP An open marketplace (OMP) is an exchange where programmatic ad inventory is bought and sold as part of an auction. The auction is run through real-time bidding (RTB), enabling inventory prices to be decided in real time. The open marketplace provides access to the broadest audience, and in a cost-effective way to all advertisers.   PMP Private marketplace (PMP) deals are programmatic advertising auctions where sellers sell premium ad inventory to a select group of advertisers based on pre-negotiated terms. This allows sellers to offer high-quality inventory, often at higher price to advertisers while maintaining full control over who can access it.   Viewable True Ad Spend or Impressions Ad spend or impressions that are both True (see True AdSpend or Impressions above) AND viewable.   Viewable True CPM The CPM of impressions that are both True (see True AdSpend or Impressions above) AND viewable.   Sellers.json implemented Ad spend or impressions where the exchange or SSP has a sellers.json file.   Supply Chain is TAG BSC Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Brand Safety Certified.   Supply Chain is TAG CAF Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Certified Against Fraud.   Supply Chain Report The TAG TrustNet report for an agency or advertiser that uses a Sankey diagram to show data about the flow of inventory across programmatic participants, from the ad server to the publishers.   True AdSpend or Impressions True impressions are impressions that meet a set of requirements to measure ad effectiveness. TAG TrustNet enables members to define their own requirements and to evaluate data reconciled across the supply chain against them. TAG TrustNet recommends defining True impression requirements based on ad quality, supply chain transparency and data consistency metrics. In TAG TrustNet the default definition for a TrueImpression is that it must be matched with data from the DSP and Ad Verification tool, is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the Ad Verification tool and DSP are the same (except if the Ad Verification tool is not able to provide all domains and\/or app names for an advertiser).   TrueCPM The CPM of impressions that met the criteria for True (see True AdSpend or Impressions above).   Unduplicated impressions Ad spend or impressions where the impressions were reported as unique by the DSP.   Unmatched with Ad Verification The amount that was paid to the publisher that was not matched with the Ad Verification log files.   Viewable according to Ad Verification tool Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the Ad Verification tool being used.   Viewable according to DSP or Ad Server Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the DSP or Ad Server being used. If viewability data is available from both systems the DSP data will be used.    </p><p>glossary</p>",

							label: "<p> responsible advertising for a responsible industry Over the last decade Real-Time Bidding (RTB) created massive efficiency for the digital advertising marketplace in opening large volumes of inventory, driving down prices and creating the opportunity for smaller sites and apps to thrive. Today it has become a large $200B market that continues to grow at an accelerated pace with a supply chain that remains complex, fragmented, partly opaque and could be even more efficient. In a context where decisions are increasingly made by technology, traditional processes do not apply and there is a need to bring a technological solution to what is essentially a technological problem.\nAs a global cross-industry initiative, TAG TrustNet is taking the industry to the next level as an always-on collaborative network providing the tools to certify the supply chain and allow everyone to be accountable, make responsible decisions and improve efficiency.\nTAG TrustNet achieves this by automating the reconciliation of data across the supply chain and recording it in an immutable shared ledger as Shared Truth: a unified record for every single ad running through the supply chain made available in near real-time.\nWith Shared Truth, TAG TrustNet enables what can be defined as Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles:\n Know your business partners: every record can be tracked back to the legal entities that are part of a transaction Know their business practices: every record gets cross-checked and verified based on financial and qualitative metrics Make timely informed business decisions: every record gets reconciled and can be acted on in near real-time  As an always-on solution, TAG TrustNet sets a major industry milestone:\n For the industry as a whole by allowing everyone to act responsibly by conducting business transactions only with identified business partners; For advertisers and agencies by increasing cost efficiency and ad effectiveness, resulting in improved brand safety and ad spend productivity; For intermediaries and publishers by getting the opportunity to access to a larger share of ad spend as identified business partners agreeing to share impression data; and For all members by reducing operating costs over the automation of data reconciliation in a data secure and private context.  Accessing TAG TrustNet is a free and easy process. Members sign a membership agreement, get verified as an existing legal business entity, get identified by a tracking ID and agree to share their impression data with their business partners through TAG TrustNet based on member requirements. In a second step, after signing a licensing agreement, a dedicated network node gets activated over which data can be imported, shared and exported. Access to data remains at all times under the control of the data owner.\nTAG TrustNet’s objective is for the entire digital advertising industry to adopt and implement the 3 principles of Responsible Advertising by becoming members and leveraging TAG TrustNet to shape a responsible future for our industry.\nThe time for TRUST is now! </p><p></p>",
