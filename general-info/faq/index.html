    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0">DLT is a breakthrough in various industries as a technology solution taking away the complexities and inefficiencies of supply chains. It allows companies to share and reconcile transaction data among trusted business partners in line with their contractual agreements in a secure and trusted collaborative environment. It most notably takes away the need for lots of different integrations between different organisations, simplifies legal agreements among participants, and allows to automate them over smart contracts. Compliance information becomes readily available and always-on reporting contributes to the reduction of expensive reconciliation and auditing.</div>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0">Building log file integrations with every partner in the ecosystem is expensive. Maintaining them when they are up and running is also expensive because it comes with a substantial commitment to keep technology up to date: over time partners will change their technology, naming conventions, access settings or specifications. With TAG TrustNet only one integration is required to get access to the logs of every other network member. Moreover, log file data can be downloaded already pre-reconciled according to defined rules and used for automated business agreement management. For these reasons, for most companies DLT will be a cheaper, more efficient way to get access log files than other methods.</div>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0"><p>Log files reconciliation requires log file data provided by various individual supply chain participants to be consistent. One way to address this question is to define detailed standards for log file formats, data fields naming conventions, taxonomies and meanings. To come to an agreement on industry logging standards is taking time and will require significant investments from adtech vendors to adjust their logging systems.</p>
<p>The other approach is to write log file data to the TAG TrustNet DLT network, where it is automatically harmonised to a common network format at the moment it is written. This approach requires less investments from ad-tech vendors, as it allows to use any formats, taxonomies and naming conventions as long as they can be harmonised to a common format. The only standard required to avoid any ambiguity is to define the meaning of data fields. With this approach the log files reconciliation functionality may be supported by the industry much faster with minimal changes required from ad-tech vendors.</p>

They do not cover cost efficiency (supply chain costs), ad delivery/reconciliation, and compliance to industry standards. By incorporating your CV data within TAG TrustNet you are able to:</p>
<p>Confirm what site and application ads actually appeared on. Matched log-level data from the DSP, SSP, ad server and CV company are used to confirm the domain that was recorded for an impression from each platform. If there are differences this can help identify technical problems, misplacement, and domain spoofing.</p>
<p>Matching cost data from the DSP and SSP means you can analyse standard verification metrics leading to better business decisions.</p>
<p>TAG TrustNet allows you to evaluate how industry standards (ads.txt and sellers.json) and certifications (TAG) get implemented in a single place to improve brand safety, and reduce fraud, malware and piracy.</p>
<p>TAG TrustNet reconciles supply chain participants data producing a single shared truth that can be used for discrepancy management, managing partner and tag deployments and improving operational efficiency.</p>

Every TAG TrustNet member shall comply with TAG TrustNet Member Requirements, which state that log-level data provided for ingestion into TAG TrustNet shall not include any Personal Data and, as such, should fall outside of the scope of data protection laws, including, without limitation, the GDPR and the CCPA. All Personal Data, and any data fields which represent “pseudonymous data,” shall be removed before the underlying dataset is ingested into TAG TrustNet.  </p>
<ul>
<li>“Personal Data” means any information defined as “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or other similar term under applicable data protection laws. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>While impression timestamps and oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs that are ingested into TAG TrustNet might be considered “pseudonymous data” in some circumstances, it is “anonymous data” in this case because:</p>
<p>&ndash; It is not possible for Fiducia, as a platform provider for TAG TrustNet, to use this data to identify an individual and;</p>
<p>&ndash; TAG TrustNet obfuscates these data fields when they are exported to reasonably prevent anyone from linking TAG TrustNet impression records to an individual (see below for more details).  </p>
<p>In addition to the above, Fiducia, as a platform provider, takes the following steps to reduce risks of re-identifiability of data ingested by, or exported from, TAG TrustNet, so as to achieve the standards of anonymization under applicable data protection laws (such as by not allowing re-identification via the “means reasonably likely to be used” by a third party, per the GDPR standard for determining whether data is “identifiable”):</p>
<p>&ndash; For all supported data sources, the TAG TrustNet Node Data Connectors filter any data fields that represent Personal Data from processing in the TAG TrustNet. Only data fields outlined in TAG TrustNet Member Requirements are ingested to by TAG TrustNet for processing.</p>
<p>&ndash; When data is exported by TAG TrustNet Members to external databases, the TAG TrustNet Node obfuscates oRTB Bid Request Impression ID, oRTB Bid Request ID, and Timestamp data fields as follows.  oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs and oRTB Bid Request IDs are replaced with anonymous impression IDs, which cannot be linked back to original oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs or oRTB Bid Request IDs.  Timestamps are rounded to 1-hour intervals.</p>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0">The terms blockchain and DLT are often used interchangeably. Blockchain is a particular type of DLT which was popularized by Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the ledger of transactions is as a sequence of blocks of data linked together through cryptography. The name comes from the fact that the ‘blocks’ are ‘chained’ in this fashion.</div>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0">A DLT Network is a network of computers, called network nodes, which implement a distributed ledger by running specialised software and communication protocols to share, synchronise and access the ledger records. When a ledger update happens, these nodes apply a consensus mechanism to agree on the ordering of transaction records and whether they should be included. The consensus mechanism allows the ledger to be tamper resistant and immutable and containing only confirmed and validated transactions. Because the nodes contain identical replicas of ledger records, users of nodes know that “What you see is what I see” when they access the ledger.</div>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0">A smart contract is a computer program stored in a distributed ledger network wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger. A smart contract might represent terms in a contract in law and create a legally enforceable obligation under the legislation of an applicable jurisdiction. Smart contracts allow organisations to automate their business relationships using software code with enforceability based on the distributed ledger records.</div>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0"><p>There are three ways in which the data from TAG TrustNet can be trusted:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source of the data being reported to TAG TrustNet is authenticated by the network, so there is no question about who is providing the data.</li>
<li>TAG TrustNet stores the impression data using distributed ledger technology which creates an immutable record of the transaction.</li>
<li>The data for each impression that is collected from all the companies that were involved in delivering it can be compared to see if there are any inconsistencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be helpful to provide a little more information about the last point. One of the key deliverables from TAG TrustNet is that the impression data that is available from each vendor who was involved in delivering an impression is being stitched together to create a single record of each transaction across the supply chain. As a result of this, the data about the same impression from different sources can be compared and inconsistences can be identified. For example, if impression is reported by DSP, but not reported by SSP or ad server - most likely it was not delivered. Here are some other examples of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impression clearing price from a SSP reports can be compared to that reported by the DSP.</li>
<li>The publisher domain recognised by a SSP can be compared to the publisher domain recognised by a verification tool (if they do not match it may be a sign of domain spoofing).</li>
<li>A SSPs-reported platform fee can be cross-checked with payment data from publishers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that TAG TrustNet cannot guarantee that vendors will report data correctly, but it registers every piece of impression level information received from vendors in the distributed ledger&ndash;ensuring that after receipt impression data can’t be changed and remains immutable. If a vendor changes data in their systems after it was reported to TTN it may be detected and proven.</p>

    <div class="card-body font-secondary text-color pt-0"><p>Some blockchain detractors have been claiming that blockchains have a massive negative impact on the environment due to high energy consumption. This is probably due to a misunderstanding around the Bitcoin use of blockchain and other types of blockchains. What is true for the Bitcoin as a public network based on a “proof-of work” protocol, requiring a digital-labor intensive “mining” process with high energy demands to validate each new block of data, is radically different for permissioned private networks. In a permissioned network, such as the one implemented by TAG TrustNet, each block can get validated by a handful of nodes acting as notaries, with the energy consumption of not more than a few PCs. The expectation with permissioned networks is that in most cases the efficiency gains provided by DLT - reducing paper trails and running automated processes to reconcile, record, audit data - will have a significant positive impact on the environment rather than the other way around. In addition to this, the TAG TrustNet platform runs distributed ledger transactions only to register large blocks of impression data instead of doing that for every impression. This further reduces the energy consumed by the platform. For more details on the efficiencies of private blockchains, please see this article from R3, the company providing the private blockchain platform used by TAG TrustNet (<a href="https://www.r3.com/blog/just-how-energy-efficient-is-your-blockchain/">https://www.r3.com/blog/just-how-energy-efficient-is-your-blockchain/</a>)</p>
<p>In addition to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical infrastructure of TAG TrustNet uses AWS and Amazon has committed to being carbon neutral by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.</li>
<li>TAG TrustNet is also working with the AD Net Zero Advertising Association through the IPA and other 3rd party companies to reduce the carbon footprint in programmatic advertising. This is done by providing transparency to advertisers and their agencies of the carbon footprint created by their ad campaigns and how they could reduce it.</li>
<li>There are also other socially responsible benefits that are available to companies using TAG TrustNet. Currently this includes reducing ad spend going to criminal activity, and in the future may involve DEI, Corporate Social Responsibility and user privacy.</li>
